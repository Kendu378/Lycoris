# Lycoris-Rewrite

Rewritten Lycoris - better logging, optimizations, error handling, faster prototyping, and more.

Powered & inspired by parts of Serenity's framework rewritten to the new coding style.

# Coding Style
Please stick to PascalCase for tables and camelCase for everything else.

For constants, please use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. 

Follow the general style of code - avoid nesting & look at other files to see how things are done.

Make OOP / class files the way which is shown in the codebase.
